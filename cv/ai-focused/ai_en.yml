    brief_motivation:
      - >-
        I’m excited to help a larger organization leverage data and modern tech to
        automate the
        previously tedious tasks, so time is spent where it matters the most.
    experience:
      - start_date: 2024-11
        company: DIKU (University of Copenhagen)
        position: Special Consultant
        summary: >-
          I serve as a special consultant across DIKU's Image Section and the university
          spin-off
          Darerl, turning rough code into production-ready pipelines, making the way
          from raw data
          to finished AI generated digital twins fast and reliable. At DIKU, I modernized
          RootPainter (Interactive ML segmentation tool) to drive adoption and maintainability
          by
          refactoring it into a conventional, pip-installable package with modern,
          searchable
          documentation (mkdocs-material) deployed via GitHub Pages.

        summary: >-
          With a 3-person IT team serving a ~70-person biotech, I adopted pragmatic
          tech to stretch resources—introducing Docker Swarm for scalable deployments
          and Streamlit for rapid internal tools—cutting time from idea to live from
          months to days. This foundation enabled an LLM-driven literature pipeline
          that scaled throughput from ~800 papers/week (5 people) to ~20,000 in 3
          hours.
