        Software & Data Platform Engineer specializing in "industrializing" scientific
        code. I
        bridge the gap between complex physical domains and reliable software by transforming
        experimental PoCs into robust production systems. I strive to develop "simple
        solutions to
        complex problems" through expertise in Developer Experience (DevEx), Modernization,
        and
        Operational Compliance (NIS2/ISO).
